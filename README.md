# Jojawhi's Rock Paper Scissors assignment for The Odin Project

For my attempt at the Rock Paper Scissors game, I wanted to make it a little more challenging. After going through the JS units in the course, I felt I had a good understanding of how to approach the basic project criteria, so I jazzed it up a little to enahnce my learning. I decided to do Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spockto get the extra practice with writing JS and to keep my CSS layout skills strong. I was never a huge fan of Big Bang Theory, but I love me some Star Trek.

## Learning Focus

The focus for this project was to practice DOM manipulation and event handlers. Most of the JS aside from the logic behind the game is focused on these two concepts.

## Takeaway

I enjoyed the project, and I probably spent more time on it than I needed to after I had satisfied the assignment criteria.

I really learned about interactivity with this project. Creating constants to represent DOM elements and then adding event handlers to those elements was drilled into my mind to the point that it seems simple to do now.

## Future Additions

I want to keep working on this in my spare time, and I have some ideas for features and fun things to add.

  - Game modes: Best of 3/5/7, Endless
  - A collapsible/hidable round history section, so you can see how each round played out if you forget.
  - A collapsible/hidable rules section for peopel who are unfamiliar with how Spock gets disproven by paper or how the Lizard poisons Spock.
  - UI style redesign

## Known Bugs

- Mobile browser
  - A spacing issue arises after a few rounds are played where the resultTextContainer gets pushed down into the selectContainer space. I suspect the fade or hidden class is not functioning properly on one of the results and leaving behind an empty space the forces the next result down.
